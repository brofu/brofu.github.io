#### Programming Language

This page records the notes of programming languages. The following languages are covered:

* Rust
* Golang
* Python
* C

Generally speaking, someone may understand a programming language from the following perspectives (top to down):

* Syntax & Specifics
    * *Basic usage of this language*
    * *Key points of some advanced usages, for example, key points of `Golang Slices`*
* Programming Paradigms & Design Patterns
    * *Good practices of programming with some langugae*
    * *Paradigms which is frequently used, for example, `Golang Context`*
    * *Common design patterns (for example, 23 patterns) implemented with some language*
* Tool Chains
    * *Tools used to construct a complex project*
* Common Libs
    * *Common used libs (which are usually widely used) of this language. For example, the `net.http` package of Golang*
* Principles & Implementations
    * *The under layer principles and implementations of a language.  For exmaple, `Java GC`, and `Golang GMP model`* 

The notes would be summarized from above mentioned dimensions.
